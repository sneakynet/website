        <h1>Preliminary VCFSW Telephone Service Ordering Information</h1>
        <p>Telephone service will be offered from the SneakyNet exhibit at VCFSW.  Want to be connected to the network?  Find out more information here.</p>

        <h2>How to Order</h2>
        <a href="#advanceorder"><h3>Ordering in Advance</h3></a>
        <p>It is preferred that individuals wishing to obtain service
            do so prior to the date of the show so that provisioning and
            planning can be completed in advance. During table/exhibit
            registration for the show, you should indicate on the form
            that you are interested in telephony services. Otherwise, you
            may reach out to maldridge directly.</p>
        <p>Prior to the show, you will be contacted to confirm the
            types and quantities of services you will require, as well as
            work out any special requirements that need to be addressed.</p>

        <a href="#lateorder"><h3>Ordering at the Show</h3></a>
        <p>While it is strongly preferrable that services be arranged
            in advance of the show, we will do our best to accomodate
            orders submitted during the show. Orders will be serviced in
            the order that they are placed, and any orders made in advance
            of the show will be at the front of the line before any placed
            during the show.</p>

        <p>At the show, you may find maldridge in person, or you may
            attempt to dial 611 from any of the phones connected to
            the show network. Once contact has been made, please
            describe the services you require so that they can be
            noted, and SneakyNet staff will establish service as soon
            as they are able to do so.</p>


        <a href="#linesandtrunks"><h2>Lines and Trunks</h2></a>
        <p>Multiple line and trunk types are available for your
            convenience.  Special lines may be possible to arrange given
            advance notice.</p>

        <p>In all cases it is appreciated if you can supply your own
            cable to reach the nearest interconnection point for the
            telephone network.  A limited supply of cables is available,
            and will be used on a first-come, first serve basis.</p>

        <a href="#potsline"><h3>Analog Telephone Line</h3></a>
        <p>A simple analog phone line, often referred to as 'POTS'
            service. The line provided will be a 2W line using
            loopstart signalling.  If you don't know what your
            equipment needs but it has an RJ11 telephone port on it,
            this is probably what you want.</p>

        <p>Analog lines will be serviced from a Cisco Integrated
            Services Router via either a Zhone or Adit channel bank
            dependent on your location on the show floor.</p>


        <a href="#norteldigital"><h3>Nortel BCM Digital Station Line</h3></a>
        <p>A digital line served off of a Nortel BCM50 small office
            switch.  Such lines require special telephones to use, and
            cannot be trunked over the larger network.  If you want to
            use a phone with one of these circuits, please indicate
            this so an appropriate cable route can be planned.</p>

        <a href="#t1"><h3>T1</h3></a>
        <p>A T1 is a digital circuit which carries 24 DS0 channels
            (8kHz x 8 bit = 64kb/s) capable of supporting voice or
            data traffic. T1s are available for both voice and data
            use with a variety of signaling types and protocols.</p>

        <p>T1s can be provided with either SF or ESF framing, and
            either AMI or B8ZS linecode, with a preference towards
            ESF/B8ZS.</p>

        <p>T1s require the use of a crossover.  A clear agreement must
            be communicated as to which end will cross over the
            connection.  While out of spec, over the distances
            involved conventional cat5/cat6 cable is suitable for T1
            connectivity.</p>

        <p>Voice signalling can be ISDN PRI or bitrobbed CAS.</p>

        <p>ISDN PRI is a trunk signaling type using a D channel and
            the ISDN Q.931 protocol. PRIs will be served out of a
            Cisco ISR using the NI-2 variant of ISDN, unless otherwise
            requested.</p>

        <p>CAS signaled T1s support multiple signalling types using
            CAS signaling bits such as FXS or FXO loopstart or
            groundstart signaling, or various types of E&M signaling.</p>

        <p>T1 circuits can also carry data as a high speed synchronous
            serial line. A number of protocols can be used to carry IP
            traffic such as PPP, frame relay, or Cisco HDLC. Other
            protocols, IP or otherwise, may be available on request.</p>

        <p>T1 circuits are also, by nature, a channelized medium which
            can split the channel allocations between multiple
            purposes, if necessary. Such an arrangement is known as a
            'fractional' T1 since only a fraction of the T1 is used
            for each purpose. In this fashion, data and voice
            services, or even multiple types of voice service can be
            mixed on a single T1 circuit.</p>

        <a href="#equipment"><h2>Equipment</h2></a>
        <p>A limited amount of equipment may be available to use with
            your SneakyNet Telephone Service.  All equipment is expected
            to be returned in the condition it was issued in.</p>

        <a href="#analogtelephone"><h3>Analog Telephones</h3></a>
        <p>A selection of analog telephones is available, ranging from
            standard office desk phones to trim-line clones.</p>

        <a href="#digitaltelephone"><h3>Nortel Digital Telephones</h3></a>
        <p>A limited number of nortel digital telephones is available.</p>

        <a href="#services"><h2>Additional Services</h2></a>
        <p>Additional services are available to connect you to the
            exciting world of the Internet and the broader Information
            Superhighway.</p>

        <a href="#huntgroups"><h3>Hunt Groups</h3></a>
        <p>Customers with multiple lines may want calls made to the
            first line while the first line is already in a call
            'hunt' to their other lines. This has the advantage that
            multi-line services such as dial-in BBSes or the like can
            utilize a single number for the convenience of callers.</p>

        <a href="#v90"><h3>Dial-Up Packet Data</h3></a>
        <p>Dial-Up Packet Data, conventionally just Dialup, will be
            provided via the circuit switched analog network.  Schemes up
            to v.90 are possible, dependant on equipment capability and
            line performance.</p>

        <p>Session authentication will be via conventional PPP session
            with username and password authentication.  You may
            request a specific username, or one will be assigned.
            Requested usernames cannot exceed 9 characters and cannot
            contain any special characters.</p>

        <a href="#datainterconnection"><h3>Packet Data Services</h3></a>
        <p>Don't have a modem but still want in on the party?  Packet
            data interconnection is available via conventional
            10/100-BaseT ethernet as well as 1G-BaseT high speed
            connections.</p>
